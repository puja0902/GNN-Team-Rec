# In summary, the Social_Aggregator class is responsible for 
# aggregating embeddings of social neighbors based on attention weights. 
# This aggregation is a common operation in graph-based neural network models, 
# especially for modeling social relationships in recommendation systems or graph-based machine learning tasks
